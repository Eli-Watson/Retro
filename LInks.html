    <P>Hello There! This page look much diffrent than many of my other pages as I want this one to look like more 
        of the classic web. Its simplicity is on purpose as I wanted to try and replicate many of The websites of the Classic web, 
    A time I never got to experince. Today there is an increassingly number of pepole who rarly stray from a handful of websites. And when I do look up something it's 
    ussally some ad ridden pice of mess that helps nobody. so ... What do we do? Well Even if we can't Find them many of these old websites are still up, Most are plan unsecured http 
    but don't let that scare y'all. To be honest This website is probbly going to be one of those lost ones. But what can you do. Ok this is less links and more rambling so let me just give you the Links.
</P>
<div class="Links">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.wiby.me/">Wibly.me</a> <p>A Search Engine for said Classic Websites. Suprise me is Fun.</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://denshi.org/">Denshi.org</a> <p>A good resouce to learn about self-hosting and other computer stuff.</p></li>
        <li><a href="https://kraftmstr.com/index.html">Kraftmstr</a> <p>One of said calssic websites. (I stole the idea for a holiday thing from here. But not the code. :)</p>
