This is a retro version of my main website. Because of this it uses all the same js as the main site, but diffrent html pages and some slightly diffrent feture sets. Also as ai was used more than I want to admit in the creation of the other site (mainly the js and some itial css) this one aims to be all me. Another big reason in the creation of this site is that some of the tings I want to add to my website look out of place on my main site and this is a good place to put them. And it looks cool.
